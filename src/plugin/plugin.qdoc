    \section1 Overview

    The Settings Plugin makes up the main Patchmanager GUI Application.

    Jolla Settings loads \l {patchmanager}{this page} which in turn loads
    PatchManagerPage, a part of \l {Patchmanager Documentation: QML Plugin}{Patchmanager QML Plugin}.

    \section2 Configuration

    The Jolla Settings plugin configuration (installed at \c
    /usr/share/jolla-settings/entries/) looks like below.  It adds an entry to
    the Settings application, and optionally can be added to the Top Menu quick
    links.

    \badcode
