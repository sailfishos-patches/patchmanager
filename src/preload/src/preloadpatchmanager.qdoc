  \indexpage Patchmanager Documentation

  \section1 Overview

  This library

  \list
  \li Intercepts calls to \l {https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html}{\c{open()}} (or \c{open64()})
  \li analyses which files the call was meant to open
  \li asks the Patchmanager Daemon (via socket) whether it knows of a patched version
  \endlist

  If this is the case, the daemon will return a path to its cachedir, and the library
  redirects the call to that file instead of the original. Otherwise, the
  \c{open()} is executed on the original file.

  Certain paths are blacklisted for these operations to reduce the risk of
  critical services, or PM itself, choking on these redirections.

  \section1 Implementation

  \section3 Blacklists:

  The following two "blacklists" cause the lib to back off redirecting calls for paths matching one of the entries in the list:

  \quotefromfile preloadpatchmanager.c
  Paths that start with one of these patterns are skipped
  \skipto static const char *blacklist_paths_startswith[]
  \printuntil };
  Paths that match exactly one of these patterns are skipped
  \skipto static const char *blacklist_paths_equal[]
  \printuntil };

  \section2 Building

  The following \c{#defines} can be used to alter the library behaviour at compile-time

  \table
  \header
    \li Define
    \li Default
    \li Description
  \row
    \li \c NO_INTERCEPT
    \li undefined
    \li If defined, compiles out all of the actual redirection code, leaving the rest in place. Can be used in extreme debugging cases to track what is going on without affecting applications.
  \row
    \li \c ALLOW_ALL_USERS
    \li defined
    \li If undefined, only allow preloading for users with an UID >= \c UID_MIN, default 100000
  \endtable

  \section1 Execution
  \section2 Installation

  Once the library is installed in one of the standard library paths, the following is added to the file \c /etc/ld.so.preload

  \badcode
  /usr/lib/libpreloadpatchmanager.so
  \endcode
  \badcode
  /usr/lib64/libpreloadpatchmanager.so
  \endcode

  which causes it to be loaded into any binary process that is launched.

  \section2 Environment

  The library reacts on the following environment variables:

  \table
  \header
    \li Variable
    \li Default
    \li Description
  \row
    \li \c NO_PM_PRELOAD
    \li undefined
    \li Makes the lib skip finding files to redirect to, effectively diabling it for practical purposes. Intended to be set for processes which should operate on unpatched original files.
  \row
    \li \c PM_PRELOAD_DEBUG
    \li undefined
    \li Enables debugging output; messages are prefixed with \c{[pm_name]}, \c{[open]}, or \c{[open64]} depending on operation.
  \endtable

  Set them to any value to make them take effect

  \section2 Socket

  The library will try to open a socket at \c{/tmp/patchmanager-socket} in order to communicate with the Patchmanager Daemon.
