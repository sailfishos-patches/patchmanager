  So the current mode of operation of Patchmanager is something like this:

  \section1 Operation Flow

  \section2 1. A Patch is "activated"

  When a user activates a patch via the App, a signal is sent to the daemon.

  The daemon will then:

  For each file the patch manipulates, a copy of the original file is put into
  a cache dir in \c /tmp, and the changes are applied there instead of on the
  original file.

  If there are paths or files involved in the patch which do not exist yet
  in the filesystem, they will be created in the cache dir, and a symlink
  pointing to them is placed in the original filesystem.
  \section2 2. A patched application is launched.

  Through library preloading, the \c libpreloadpatchmanager.so library is
  injected into the launching binary.

  \section2 3. The Preload Library:

  \list
  \li Intercepts calls to \l {https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html}{\c{open()} (or \c{open64()})},
  \li analyzes which files the call was meant to open
  \li  asks the Patchmanager daemon (via socket) whether it knows of a patched version.
  \endlist

  If yes, the daemon will return a path to its cachedir, and the library
  redirects the call to that file instead of the original. Otherwise, the
  \c{open()} is executed on the original file.

  Certain paths are blacklisted for these operations to reduce the risk of
  critical services, or PM itself, choking on these redirections.

  \note After activating a Patch , the daemon may also inform the UI that some
  apps or services need restart. The UI client is expected to issue the command
  to restart these soon.
  As long as the corresponding preocesses are not restarted, the effect of the
  applied patch will not show, or may only show partially, depending on the "patch
  history" of the respective process.

  \section1 Patch Installation
  There are three ways a Patch can end up on the system:

  \list
  \li Web Catalog
  \li RPM package
  \li TAR package
  \li manual installation
  \endlist

  \section2 Patch folder structure

  All Patches managed by PM are installed under \c /usr/share/patchmanager/patches/NAME,
  where NAME is a directory having a unique name.

  That directory must contain at least two files: a \c JSON file called
  \c patch.json containing metadata, and a \c diff file called \c{unified_diff.patch}.

  It may optionally also contain:
    \list
    \li Qt translation (.qm) files
    \li icon files in PNG format
    \li a QML file called \c main.qml (whose root element is a Sailfish Silica \c{Page}).
    \li other QML-compatible files which are referenced/loaded from \c main.qml
    \endlist

  \note the directory NAME is usually and by convention the same as the patch
  metadata field \c name, but that is not a requirement. NAME should be
  reasonably unique though, to avoid name clashes with Patches from others.

  \section2 Web Catalog

  Installation via the Patchmanager Web Catalog is the most common and recomended way of installing a patch.
  This is done through the Patchmanager UI, by selecting \uicontrol install on the \l {WebPatchPage}{Patch Page}.

  PM will download metadata and a tarball from the Web Catalog, extract the
  tarball into the patch storage location, and generate the necessary JSON file
  from the metadata.

  \section2 RPM package

  Patches may be distributed as RPM files, which assure the placement of files
  according to the structure explained above.  RPM also provides advanced
  features like dependencies and scriptlets which may be necessary for correct
  operation or installation of a Patch.

  \section2 TAR package

  Patch developers may sometimes distribute Patches in \c tar format. Usually
  they also contain the necessary files, but the contents of the tarball may
  differ, and recipients of them must assure the layout given above is set up
  correctly.

  \section2 manual installation

  Patch developers or users may want to quickly place a Patch under PM's
  supervision without going through the hassle of packaging and installing.
  This can be done easily, as long as the formats given above are followed.

  \section2 D-Bus System Service
  \target dbus-sys
  The D-Bus services reserve the bus name \c org.SfietKonstantin.patchmanager

  It is defined as follows:

  \quotefile dbus/org.SfietKonstantin.patchmanager.xml

  Calls can be issued e.g. like this:

  \badcode
      dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.SfietKonstantin.patchmanager /org/SfietKonstantin/patchmanager org.SfietKonstantin.patchmanager.checkforUpdates

      \endtable

  \c lipstick-patchmanager.service watches the state of the Lipstick service.
  If Lipstick crashes, Patchmanager Daemon assumes it was caused by a patch
  and goes into \c failed state. In  this state, all enabled services are
  disabled, and PM must be reactivated via the GUI.

  \section1 Manual Invocation

  Apart from using the appropriate tools manipulating tools like \c systemctl,
  \c busctl, or \c dbus-send, the patchmanager binary can serve as a CLI as
  well if called from command line.
  See the output of \c{patchmanager --help} and PatchManagerObject::process()
  for more information.

  There is also a shell script called \c patchmanager-tool, wrapping the capabilities of \c patchmanager to generate more useful functions.

  \note At the time this was written, \c patchmanager-tool is not yet distributed with the default packages. You can find it in the source repository though, under \c src/tools/.

  \section1 Logging and Debugging

  Debug logging of the daemon can be configured using the environment file
  located in \c /var/lib/environment/patchmanager/10-dbus.conf setting the \c
  QT_LOGGING_RULES variable to e.g. \c{"*.debug=true"}

  After changing this, the system service must be restarted so it can pick up
  the new values.
