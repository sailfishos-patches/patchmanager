See original, but somehow technically problematic SVG icon (created with Inkscape 0.48.4 r9939) uploaded by Coderus 2016-12-14 for Patchmanager 2 at [`patchmanager-icon.svg`](patchmanager-icon.svg).

The [`patchmanager_200x200.png`](patchmanager_200x200.png) and [`patchmanager_86x86.png`](patchmanager_86x86.png) are exported versions (2014-01-22) of an older SVG by SfietKonstantin, which is presuambly lost; these PNG icons are renamed copies of their originals in [`src/share/`](../src/share/). 

For the icons in the [`social-media`](social-media) directory, the [`patchmanager_200x200.png`](social-media/patchmanager_200x200.png) was simply put on a larger, transparent canvas to create [`patchmanager_284x284.png`](social-media/patchmanager_284x284.png) (200 × √2 = 282,842712475, so the icon proper is fully visible when clipped circularly, as GitHub does it at multiple places) and [`patchmanager_480x240.png`](social-media/patchmanager_480x240.png) (2:1 "social media" format, see in GitHub's general settings page of a project).

The original SVG of the [`icon-patchmanager_100x100.png`](icon-patchmanager_100x100.png) (with the patch in red hue) seems to be lost, too.
