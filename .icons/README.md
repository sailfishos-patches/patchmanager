See original, but somehow technically problematic SVG icon (created with Inkscape 0.48.4 r9939) uploaded by Coderus 2016-12-14 for Patchmanager 2 at [`/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/blob/master/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg).

The `patchmanager_200x200.png` and `patchmanager_86x86.png` are exported versions (2014-01-22) of an older SVG by SfietKonstantin, which is presuambly lost; these PNG icons are renamed copies of their originals in [`/src/share`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/tree/master/src/share). 

For the icons in the "social-media" directory, the `patchmanager_200x200.png` was simply put on a larger, transparent canvas to create `patchmanager_284x284.png` (200 × √2 = 282,842712475, so the icon proper is fully visible when clipped circularly, as GitHub does it at multiple places) and `patchmanager_480x240.png` (2:1 "social media" format, see in GitHub's general settings page of a project).

The original SVG of the `icon-patchmanager_100x100.png` (with the patch in red hue) seems to be lost, too.
