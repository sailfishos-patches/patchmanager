See original, but technically problematic SVG icon in [`/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/blob/master/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg).

The `patchmanager_200x200.png` seems to be an exported version of this SVG (when, by whom and how is unknown), which was simply put on a larger, transparent canvas to create `patchmanager_284x284.png` (200 × √2 = 282,842712475, so the icon proper is fully visible when clipped circularly) and `patchmanager_480x240.png` (2:1 "social media" format).

The original SVG of the `icon-patchmanager_100x100.png` seems too be lost.
