See original, but technically problematic SVG icon created by SfietKonstantin for Patchmanager 2 at [`/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/blob/master/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg).

The `patchmanager_200x200.png` and `patchmanager_86x86.png` apparently are exported versions of this SVG, which are renamed copies of their originals in [`/src/share`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/tree/master/src/share). 

For the icons in the "social-media" directory, the `patchmanager_200x200.png` was simply put on a larger, transparent canvas to create `patchmanager_284x284.png` (200 × √2 = 282,842712475, so the icon proper is fully visible when clipped circularly, as GitHub does it at multiple places) and `patchmanager_480x240.png` (2:1 "social media" format, see in GitHub's general settings page of a project).

The original SVG of the `icon-patchmanager_100x100.png` (with the patch in red hue) seems too be lost.
