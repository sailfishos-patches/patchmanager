See original, but technically problematic SVG icon in [`/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg`](https://github.com/sailfishos-patches/patchmanager/blob/master/src/icons/svgs/icon-m-patchmanager2.svg).

The `patchmanager_200x200.png` seems to be an exported version of this SVG (when, by whom and how is unknown), whcih was simply put on al larger, transparent canvas to create `patchmanager_284x284.png` (200 × √2 = 282,842712475) and `patchmanager_480x240.png`.

The original of the `icon-patchmanager_100x100.png` seems too be lost.
